            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The world is too little and too low-prized for the minde of the leaÅ¿t, of the pooreÅ¿t man, who hath the underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a man: what <hi>A nothing</hi> then is it to (Å¿uch as <hi>yours</hi> are) <hi>Great and noble mindes?</hi> And yet (as inconÅ¿idera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it is) they who have only the world to rejoyce in, Å¿hall not (Å¿hortly) have a world to rejoyce in. The faÅ¿hion of it paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth away daily, and the matter of it is of no long continuance. The beauty of it was stained in its infancy, and the frame of it must be conÅ¿umed when it is a few (who knowes how few) years elder. This Å¿hould call off our thoughts from eager earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purÅ¿uits, and pitch them upon a higher and more <hi>enduring Å¿ubÅ¿tance.</hi> This Å¿hould provoke us to put the <hi>moon</hi> (all <hi>changeable excellencies</hi>) under our feet, and make us reÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e till we are cloathed with the <hi>Sun,</hi> an <hi>eternall excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?</hi> 'Twas the deÅ¿igne of the enÅ¿uing Sermon, to befriend Å¿ouls with Å¿uch a change of cloathing: and to entice them into the joys of a <hi>name written in Heaven,</hi> that they might not too much read or rejoyce in any, (no not their own) on earth.
<pb facs="tcp:113435:3"/> I know the victories and Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿es of a just warre, endebt us not only to Thankfulnes, but to Ioy. Such victories are the exactest pieces both of the wiÅ¿dom and power of God; God is called a <hi>man of warre,</hi> but nothing Å¿hews him <hi>more a God then warre.</hi> And among all warres, a warre with Å¿pirits, (though but with the Å¿pirits of men) Å¿hews most of God. The great promiÅ¿e of reÅ¿toring <hi>IeruÅ¿alem</hi> is thus prefac'd. <hi>Thus Å¿aith the Lord, which Å¿tretcheth out the Heavens, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the Å¿pirit of man within him,</hi> (Zech. 12. 1.) All reforming about Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, begins at the forming of Å¿pirits. Whether God forms Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, or breaks Å¿pirits (which will not receive his form) his work is admirable. God hath begun a warre with, and a work upon Å¿pirits in our dayes: Some Å¿pirits are beautifully formed, others are juÅ¿tly broken. T'is a duty to rejoyce in both, chiefly in the former. We muÅ¿t rejoyce (for the Angels in heaven do) when we hear the Å¿pirits of other men are formed, but the beÅ¿t cauÅ¿e of joy is when we finde our own are. How much Å¿oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the publike is reformed without, or how many Å¿oever are formed within, yet if any heart lie ruin'd, or life unÅ¿hap't, he may (in the midÅ¿t of all theÅ¿e joys and triumphs, for he Å¿hall) <hi>lie down in Å¿orrow.</hi> That <hi>your LordÅ¿hips</hi> may have many <hi>rejoicing daies,</hi> and a <hi>rejoycing eternity<g ref="char:punc">âª</g>

            </p>
            <p>Yea, Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t, I know it to be Å¿o; this is not a vain boaÅ¿t of valour, (like theirs, who will vaunt they have kill'd the Devil; and run Å¿trange adventures, when they Å¿carce dare look an enemy in the face,) I my Å¿elf can bear you wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e, that you have faithfully and effectually acted your commiÅ¿Å¿ion: the iÅ¿Å¿ues of your Å¿ervice have been glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in mine eye. <hi>And he Å¿aid unto them, I beheld Satan like lightning fall from Heaven,</hi> verÅ¿. 18. The powers of darkneÅ¿Å¿e cannot Å¿tand before the GoÅ¿pel of light: <hi>The Devil, the prince of the ayr is no match for ChriÅ¿t; no nor for the meaneÅ¿t of the Å¿ervants of ChriÅ¿t, who go forth armed with his name and power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauÅ¿e ChriÅ¿t found that theÅ¿e Å¿ervants of his had managed their former commiÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿o well; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is Å¿o far from calling it in, that he inlargeth it at the 19 verÅ¿e; <hi>Behold, I give you power to tread on Å¿erpents and Å¿corpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing Å¿hall by any means hurt you.</hi> Go forth again in this armour of power with which I have girt you, and I warrant you <hi>Å¿word-free, and Å¿hot-free, nothing</hi> (either on earth or in hell) <hi>Å¿hall by any means</hi> (Å¿trength or Å¿tratagem) <hi>hurt you;</hi> all the world will be againÅ¿t you, but I am with you, take courage, nothing Å¿hall hurt you: therefore on again in this warfare, you Å¿hall (as my Å¿elf) go forth <hi>conquering and to conquer.</hi>

            <p>Now, who was able to bear Å¿uch a burden of honour from theÅ¿e paÅ¿t and promiÅ¿ed victories with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How many by hearing a report of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿ts over other men, have been overcome with their own pride! <hi>It is an eaÅ¿ier matter to gain Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿es then to bear them well.</hi> ChriÅ¿t (who knows the meaÅ¿ure of every Å¿pirit) Å¿eems to Å¿uggeÅ¿t, that even the good Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his DiÅ¿ciples began to over-act upon theÅ¿e victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries over evil Å¿pirits. Hence he gives them an allay by counÅ¿el and caution, not to raiÅ¿e their joy too high upon this point. And more, he diverts their joy (which he Å¿aw ready to overÅ¿low the banks of that chanell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was) into another chanell, wide and capacious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold all the inundations of it: <hi>NotwithÅ¿tanding, in this rejoice not, that the Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject unto you; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoice in this, that your names are written in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Å¿hall not Å¿tay upon any anxious diviÅ¿ion of the text; There are two clear parts in it: The one Corrective; The other Directive.</p>
            <p>The Corrective part lies in the firÅ¿t words, wherein ChriÅ¿t checks and Å¿tops the Å¿uÅ¿pected exceÅ¿Å¿es of their joy, for victories gained over evil Å¿pirits: <hi>Notwithstanding, in this rejoice not, that the Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject unto you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Directive part lies in the later words, Å¿hewing them a joy wherein there could be no exceÅ¿Å¿e; <hi>but rather rejoice in this, becauÅ¿e your names are written in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NotwithÅ¿tanding, in this rejoice not.</hi>] Joy is the opening and dilatation of the heart upon the receiving of Å¿ome preÅ¿ent good thing; as Å¿orrow is the coarctation, the Å¿hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or locking up of the heart, upon the preÅ¿Å¿ure of Å¿ome preÅ¿ent evil. <hi>Rejoice not,</hi> that is, let not your hearts open too much in receiving this object. The negation is not abÅ¿olute, but only comparative; Å¿o it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded

            <p>The words thus opened, yeeld plenty of Å¿eaÅ¿onable and profitable inÅ¿tructions. FirÅ¿t this. <hi>Evil Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject to the power of ChriÅ¿t working in his Saints and Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</hi> The Devil is Å¿ubject not only to the immediate and perÅ¿onall power of ChriÅ¿t, but to his mediate and miniÅ¿teriall power. The Å¿ubduing of the Devil was not a buÅ¿ineÅ¿Å¿e confined to that age wherein ChriÅ¿t Å¿ojourn'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113435:6"/> on earth Å¿uch victories are obtained every day. Such conqueÅ¿ts as the DiÅ¿ciples obtained are very rare; And I intend not a diÅ¿courÅ¿e about the poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion, or diÅ¿Å¿poÅ¿eÅ¿Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of evil Å¿pirits: but there is an ordinary way of Å¿ubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of the Devil, in the miniÅ¿tration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pel. The GoÅ¿pel is the miniÅ¿tration of the holy Spirit, and therefore it muÅ¿t needs be victory over the evil Å¿pirit. Thus the unclean Å¿pirit is made to diÅ¿lodge. The Divel is Å¿eldom permitted to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e the body of any man; but he poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿es the Å¿ouls of all wicked men. And though the Divel be caÅ¿t out of the Å¿ouls of all beleevers, yet he never ceaÅ¿es to oppoÅ¿e their Å¿ouls. Every time a Å¿inner is converted, an evil Å¿pirit is Å¿ubdued; and every time a temptation is reÅ¿iÅ¿ted by the Saints, an evil Å¿pirit is foiled. The Divel is a great prince, and he hath more then halfe the world his Å¿ubjects; Many millions, and among them many Kings of the earth doe him homage, and Å¿toop to his commands. But how great Å¿oever he is, and how many Å¿oever follow him, yet he is made to Å¿toop to the leaÅ¿t of the Saints: That roaring Lion couches to them, and they tread upon this Å¿erpent. <hi>The God of peace bruiÅ¿es Satan under their feet,</hi> Rom. 16. 20. BeÅ¿ides, as evil Å¿pirits are Å¿ubdued, which work in, or againÅ¿t the Å¿ouls of men; So evil Å¿pirits are kept from hurting and afflicting the bodies and outward eÅ¿tates of men. For as good Angels incamp about the godly to guard and protect them: Å¿o evil Angels incamp againÅ¿t the godly to anoy and vex them<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> If the power of ChriÅ¿t, to this day, did not maÅ¿ter and Å¿ubdue the power of thoÅ¿e evil Å¿pirits, they would make Å¿trange confuÅ¿ions in the world quickly.</p>
            <p>The Divels are under a twofold chaine; FirÅ¿t, under a chain of juÅ¿tice: So the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Iude</hi> at the Å¿ixth verÅ¿e of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113435:6"/> his EpiÅ¿tle, <hi>They are reÅ¿erved in everlaÅ¿ting chains,</hi> (they can never wear them out, or file them off) <hi>under darknes to the judgement of the great day.</hi> Secondly, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a chaine of providence, God lets them goe abroad, but never without this chain; He gives them Å¿cope, and checks them as himÅ¿elf pleaÅ¿es. Wicked men <hi>are led captive by Satan at his will,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 26. and Satan is led captive at the will of JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t. He cannot act ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himÅ¿elf or by his inÅ¿truments, but as permitted; and if ChriÅ¿t oppoÅ¿e, both his power and the power of his inÅ¿truments is Å¿topt and broken. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypt (Rev. 20. 1, 2.) <hi>Saw an Angel (ChriÅ¿t) come down from Heaven, having the key of the bottomleÅ¿se pit, and a great chain in his hand, and he laid hold on the dragon that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which is the Divel and Satan, and bound him a thouÅ¿and years, and caÅ¿t him into the bottomleÅ¿Å¿e pit, and Å¿hut him up, and Å¿et a Å¿eal upon him, that he Å¿hould deceive the nations no more, till the thouÅ¿and years Å¿hould be fulfilled<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> and after that he muÅ¿t be looÅ¿ed for a little Å¿eaÅ¿on.</hi> Opinions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> are very various, about the preciÅ¿e time of Satans binding and looÅ¿ing; But we may hence conclude an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luÅ¿trious proof for this point in generall, That Satan is Å¿ubject to the power of ChriÅ¿t. He bindes him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the nations, and he can binde him from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling either perÅ¿ons or nations.</p>
            <p>This magnifies the power of <hi>ChriÅ¿t,</hi> he makes evil Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits Å¿ubject. This is a conqueÅ¿t beyond all thoÅ¿e of the <hi>Roman ConÅ¿uls or CaeÅ¿ars;</hi> there was never any of them that brought the Divel home in chains. Evil Å¿pirits were never dragged at their chariots of triumph. ThoÅ¿e con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours were themÅ¿elves captives to theÅ¿e Å¿pirits. And while they procured liberty for the common-wealth, they themÅ¿elves were the Å¿ervants of corruption, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113435:7"/> Å¿laves to Satan; <hi>for of whom</hi> (or by what) <hi>any maie is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, of the Å¿ame is he brought in bondage,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 19.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This may encourage us in the greateÅ¿t diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. If Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject to the power of ChriÅ¿t a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the Saints; then, what is there in the world but may be Å¿ubjected by this power, There is no power greater then the power of Å¿pirits. One Å¿pirit deÅ¿troyed a mighty army in one night, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 35. Can fleÅ¿h and blood, can gates of braÅ¿Å¿e and walls of Å¿tone Å¿tand out, when Å¿pirits themÅ¿elves muÅ¿t yeeld? Every creature hath its Å¿trength in its Å¿pirits; There are corporall Å¿pirits, as well as Å¿pirituall Å¿pirits. There are Å¿pirits of the body, produced out of the matter, being the finer, purer and more Å¿ublimate parts of it: Å¿pirits animall in the brain, vitall in the heart, and naturall in the liver, theÅ¿e are the Å¿trength of our bodies. And there are Å¿pirits in things without life, TheÅ¿e Å¿pirits are their Å¿trength alÅ¿o; the Å¿pirit of wine is the Å¿trength of the wine, Å¿o of any other liquour. Spirits extracted are the Å¿trength of any Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tance contracted into a narrow room. There is a Å¿pirit of a Å¿pirit. <hi>The Å¿pirit of the minde,</hi> EpheÅ¿. 4. 23. <hi>Be renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Å¿pirit of your minde;</hi> This Å¿pirit of the minde is the Å¿trength of the minde. To Å¿pend Å¿pirits is to Å¿pend Å¿trength, and to get Å¿pirits is to get Å¿trength, both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde. When the Prophet would Å¿hew that the horÅ¿es of the Egyptians were weak, he Å¿aith, <hi>Their horÅ¿es are fleÅ¿h and not Å¿pirit,</hi> (IÅ¿a. 31. 3.) and the ApoÅ¿tle to Å¿hew how Å¿trong. Devils are, <hi>EpheÅ¿.</hi> 6. 12. Å¿aith, <hi>We wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tle not againÅ¿t</hi> (groÅ¿Å¿e things) <hi>fleÅ¿h and blood,</hi> but againÅ¿t <hi>principalities and powers, againÅ¿t the rulers of the darkneÅ¿Å¿e of this world, against Å¿pirituall wickednes in high places.</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wickednes is wicked Å¿pirits: and becauÅ¿e they <hi>are Å¿pirits,</hi> therefore they <hi>are powers.</hi> In evil Å¿pirits there
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113435:7"/> is power, much more in good Å¿pirits, and moÅ¿t of all in <hi>the beÅ¿t Å¿pirit</hi> the Holy GhoÅ¿t <hi>ye Å¿hall receive power, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Holy GhoÅ¿t is come upon you,</hi> Act. 1. 8. whereÅ¿oever Å¿pirit is, there is power. The Å¿pirit of a man is of Å¿uch Å¿trength that it is able to beare his infirmity; our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities are our heavieÅ¿t part. <hi>Nothing calls for more Å¿trength then the bearing of our own infirmities, or the infirmities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men.</hi> Yet while a man can hold up his Å¿pirit and maintain that, he may beare (and rejoyce in) the heavieÅ¿t burthen of his own outward infirmities. A Å¿trong Å¿pirit Å¿trengthens the weakeÅ¿t, and a weak Å¿pirit weakens the Å¿trongeÅ¿t body or minde.</p>
            <p>The Å¿um of all is this, Å¿pirits are Å¿trong, and evil Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are Å¿tronger then all fleÅ¿h, yet theÅ¿e are Å¿ubject to the power of ChriÅ¿t; then never fear fleÅ¿h and blood, fire and Å¿word, when you heare Å¿pirits muÅ¿t Å¿ubmit. When ChriÅ¿t would aÅ¿Å¿ure the Church that it Å¿hould Å¿tand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t all oppoÅ¿ition, he promiÅ¿es <hi>the gates of hell Å¿hall not prevail againÅ¿t it,</hi> Matth 16. 18. that is, the power of evil Å¿pirits Å¿hall not; and if the gates of hell cannot, Å¿urely gates of earth Å¿hall never prevail. We may be confident if Å¿pirits cannot, fleÅ¿h and blood Å¿hall not doe us any hurt, while ChriÅ¿t is with us. This leads us to the Å¿econd ObÅ¿ervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is matter of joy to bring Å¿pirits, evil Å¿pirits into Å¿ubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> The DiÅ¿ciples paÅ¿Å¿ion was not without reaÅ¿on, when they rejoyced to Å¿ee Å¿pirits Å¿toop: it is no Å¿mall priviledge to make evil Å¿pirits Å¿toop, whether they be evil Å¿pirits tempting and troubling without, or moving within us.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is a glorious victory to overcome a temptation to Å¿inne. Every time we doe Å¿o, we overcome a Devil: The ApoÅ¿tle <hi>James</hi> encourages us, <hi>ReÅ¿iÅ¿t the Devil, and he will flee from you:</hi> that is, he will be Å¿ubject to you. You drive away the Devil every time you Å¿tand it out in a temptation and Å¿tand faÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>It is a great victory to overcome the Å¿innefull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are in our own hearts; To overcome paÅ¿Å¿ion and corruption within, is like the overcoming of a temptation from without: The evil Å¿pirit is vanquiÅ¿hed in both. The <hi>Sadduces</hi> denyed all Å¿pirits (<hi>Act.</hi> 23. 8.) and others have affirmed, that good and evil Å¿pirits are onely good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil motions within us. I abominate the errour, and yet there is a truth Å¿omewhat like it. Good or evil motions within us, are (in a Å¿enÅ¿e) good or evil Å¿pirits; For as that which is borne of the good Å¿pirit is Å¿pirit (<hi>Joh.</hi> 3.) So that which is borne of the evil Å¿pirit is Å¿pirit too. Every evil motion in us is borne of the Devil; who though he be not the immediate parent of all Å¿uch motions, yet he was the immediate parent of that corruption from whence Å¿uch motions are derived. So that though theÅ¿e Å¿infull paÅ¿Å¿ions are not thoÅ¿e Å¿pirits; yet they have the Å¿trength and life of evil Å¿pirits in them. Hence <hi>Solomon</hi> puts the glory of a conqueÅ¿t over them, beyond the glory of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conqueÅ¿ts; Pro. 16. 32. <hi>He that is Å¿low to anger, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the mighty; and he that ruleth his Å¿pirit,</hi> (that is, who overcomes his Å¿infull Å¿pirit, and makes it Å¿ubject to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113435:8"/> him) <hi>is better then he that taketh a City.</hi> We are called to bleÅ¿Å¿e God for taking a City this day: if we overcome our Å¿elves, and rule our own Å¿pirits, this is a more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conqueÅ¿t, then that we bleÅ¿Å¿e God for this day, the taking of a City, <hi>He that ruleth his Å¿pirit, is better then he that taketh a City.</hi> I beÅ¿eech you, Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle <hi>Peter, 1 EpheÅ¿. 2. 11. As pilgrims and Å¿trangers abstain from fleÅ¿hly lusts, which warre againÅ¿t the Å¿oul. FleÅ¿hly lusts</hi> are Å¿piritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies; <hi>AbÅ¿taining from theÅ¿e,</hi> is victory over theÅ¿e; we kill them by fleeing from them. This is the greateÅ¿t warre, and the iÅ¿Å¿ues of it are of greateÅ¿t conÅ¿equence. It is more noble to Å¿ubdue luÅ¿ts within us, then Armies without us; And it is more advantage to us to conquer luÅ¿ts then to conquer the world. <hi>Better be a Paul, then an Alexander.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, It is matter of great joy when the evil Å¿pirits of men are overcome; This is the hardeÅ¿t part of our warre with men, and the beÅ¿t. Battels are but half won when onely the bodies of men are wonne; then it is a thorow victory when we are victours over their Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. The counÅ¿el which that <hi>Indian Gymno-Å¿ophiÅ¿t Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> gave <hi>Alexander</hi> about managing of his warre, was this; <hi>Get into the heart of your enemies Countrey,</hi> which he taught him by the embleam of a great Oxe-hide Å¿pread upon the ground: He adviÅ¿ed <hi>Alexander</hi> to get into the heart of the Enemies Countrey. My humble advice to you, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> is, <hi>to get into the heart of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> While nothing is conquered but the bodies of men and Cities, you are but upon the borders of victory.</p>
            <p>There is a double conqueÅ¿t over Å¿pirits, one is the <hi>chaining of Å¿pirits:</hi> the other, is <hi>the changing of Å¿pirits:</hi> this later is a bleÅ¿Å¿ed conqueÅ¿t, not onely to thoÅ¿e who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113435:9"/> but to thoÅ¿e who are overcome. The Parliament hath cauÅ¿e this day to bleÅ¿Å¿e God for Å¿ubjecting evil Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to them; but I may Å¿ay, (without a figure or the leaÅ¿t Å¿train to truth) moÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject to them but as the Divels were Å¿ubject to the DiÅ¿ciples; 'tis but a forced and a conÅ¿trained Å¿ubjection, a chain is put upon their Å¿pirits, their Å¿pirits are not changed: they are Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, becauÅ¿e they cannot longer prevail and have their wills. We have cauÅ¿e (I Å¿ay) to bleÅ¿Å¿e God for this. The Prophet foretelleth what Å¿ubjection Å¿hall be made at laÅ¿t to the Church, (<hi>IÅ¿a. 60. 14) The Å¿onnes alÅ¿o of them that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted thee, Å¿hall come bending unto thee, and all that deÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed thee, Å¿hall bow themÅ¿elves down at the Å¿oles of thy feet,</hi> &amp;c. It is a mercy when men are made to bow; but it will be our glory, when all Å¿hall willingly bow to the throne of truth and holineÅ¿Å¿e, to the Scepter of judgement and righteouÅ¿nes. It is well for us when fire and Å¿word makes enemies Å¿ubmit; but it will be beÅ¿t with all, when repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Å¿orrow for Å¿inne, when honeÅ¿ty and grace makes men Å¿ubmit. When men Å¿ubmit from a change of their principles, not from a change only of providences: from a change wrought in their hearts, not from a change wrought in their Å¿tates. God hath fulfilled that prayer of the PÅ¿almiÅ¿t, (<hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 68. 30.) in our dayes. He hath <hi>rebuked the company of Spear-men,</hi> or (as the letter of the Hebrew gives it) <hi>the beaÅ¿ts of the reeds,</hi> of which Å¿peares were anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently made, and to which they are (in faÅ¿hion) like.

               </hi> that is, Å¿uch as would not Å¿ubmit. This the Lord hath done already.</p>

            <p>Now let this be a word to you, <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> who are Å¿o highly intereÅ¿ted in the publique affaires, let your deÅ¿igne be eÅ¿pecially to make Å¿pirits Å¿ubject to you by a willing Å¿ubjection. Endeavour that in the day of your power as it is in the day of ChriÅ¿ts power (<hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 110.) the people may be not only Å¿ubject, but willing; That their Å¿ubjection to the Parliament may be (in its Å¿phear) like that of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the GoÅ¿pel, (2 Cor. 9. 13.) <hi>a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿sed Å¿ubjection, not a forced Å¿ubjection.</hi> The greateÅ¿t part of your warre is with the Å¿pirits of men; it is Å¿aid of <hi>Saul, (1 Sam 16. 14.) That the Å¿pirit of the Lord departed from him, and an evil Å¿pirit from the Lord troubled him,</hi> that evil Å¿pirit was it which encreaÅ¿ed his envy, and continued the warre againÅ¿t <hi>David.</hi> The PhariÅ¿ees Å¿aid of ChriÅ¿t, (<hi>Joh. 10. 20.

Were we more humble, we might he more quiet; and the reaÅ¿on why Å¿o few have their deÅ¿ires, is, becauÅ¿e Å¿o many reÅ¿olve to have their wills.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the evil Å¿pirits of <hi>envy and malice.</hi> Many are Å¿ick of other mens health, and poor with other mens rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113435:10"/> and diÅ¿appointed by their neighbours Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e: impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent envy thus rotting the bones, breeds rancorous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in the heart, and both break out to the danger of the whole body. Could we bear the good of others, it would be better for our Å¿elves.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the evil Å¿pirits of <hi>errour and falÅ¿ehood</hi> unquiet our times. What a calmnes would follow if theÅ¿e were caÅ¿t out of every heart. A Å¿pirit of errour deÅ¿erves every mans abhorrence: though a perÅ¿on erring may challenge our patience. This Å¿pirit of errour is extream bad: but a Å¿pirit of falÅ¿e-hood is farre worÅ¿e. All agree, they may be Å¿omewhat borne with, who erre conÅ¿cienciouÅ¿ly, (which is very poÅ¿Å¿ible) But they are inÅ¿ufferable, who act unconÅ¿cionably, which is very uÅ¿uall.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the evil Å¿pirits of <hi>jealouÅ¿ie and Å¿elf-love.</hi> I put theÅ¿e together, becauÅ¿e ungrounded jealouÅ¿ie of others is commonly accompanied with inordinate love of our Å¿elves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Å¿pirit of jealouÅ¿y</hi> (Å¿o it is called) <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 14. is the diÅ¿turber of Kingdomes as well as of families. And <hi>Å¿elf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love</hi> is Å¿et in the head of that <hi>black Army,</hi> which is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ied to make <hi>perillous times in the laÅ¿t dayes,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>Above all, there is an evil Å¿pirit which I may call the <hi>Beelzebub of this generation, or the Prince of Devils,</hi> that is <hi>a Å¿pirit of diviÅ¿ion.</hi> This workes in all places almoÅ¿t in all hearts. DiviÅ¿ion Å¿eems to be the great deÅ¿igne againÅ¿t us; That while we act Å¿imply, we may be univerÅ¿ally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome. This Å¿pirit is grown Å¿o cunning, that it can work diÅ¿tances by a motion, or an endeavour for union. While many are ready to Å¿ay and pray, <hi>Let us not divide, though we cannot agree;</hi> yet are moÅ¿t ready to divide upon every diÅ¿agreement. And while it is almoÅ¿t in every mans mouth, <hi>Let us be one in affection, though we cannot be
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113435:10"/> one in opinion,</hi> yet every man almoÅ¿t acts, as if neither one earth nor one heaven could hold thoÅ¿e who hold not one opinion.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e Å¿pirits and Å¿uch as theÅ¿e are the troublers of our peace: and unleÅ¿Å¿e theÅ¿e Å¿pirits are changed, or at leaÅ¿t chained all fleÅ¿h is in danger to periÅ¿h among us. The chaining of them may make our times peaceable; but the change of them will make our times glorious. How hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Å¿hould we be, if a Å¿pirit of humility and meeknes, of charity and brotherly kindnes; of truth and uprightnes, of Å¿elf-deniall and ardent deÅ¿ires of maintaining the unity of the Å¿pirit in the bond of peace, poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed all our hearts?</p>
            <p>Right Honourable, if once you had received letters of credit and good aÅ¿Å¿urance, that evil Å¿pirits were foiled, and had received a blow, either in the eaÅ¿t or weÅ¿t, north or Å¿outh, and that a better Å¿pirit were acting in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you would have cauÅ¿e to keep Å¿uch a day of ThankÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and praiÅ¿e to God, as you never kept to this day. Till a conqueÅ¿t be gained over the Å¿pirits of men, our conqueÅ¿ts over men will not give us reÅ¿t. And though I would not leÅ¿Å¿en the mercies of God, eÅ¿pecially at this time when we come to bleÅ¿Å¿e him for Å¿o great a mercy, as we this day commemorate: yet I Å¿ay, what heart almoÅ¿t can we have to bleÅ¿Å¿e God, or be enlarged in his PraiÅ¿es for Å¿ubduing bodies, Towns and Cities, while legions of evil Å¿pirits in camp in Å¿o many places, and quarter in Å¿o many hearts. A conqueÅ¿t over Å¿pirits, is the glory of all our other conqueÅ¿ts.</p>
            <p>Therefore (Right Honourable) I Å¿ay it again, let the Å¿treÅ¿Å¿e of your counÅ¿els and deÅ¿ignes be laid againÅ¿t theÅ¿e Å¿pirits. The Å¿word may work an unwilling Å¿ubjection; God only can work a Å¿ubjection of the will. Yet two
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:113435:11"/> things done by men, by men (as your <hi>Selves</hi> are) in Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Authority, will contribute much towards this Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. FirÅ¿t, juÅ¿tice done, and done impartially, for, and upon all. Secondly, countenance and encouragement gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to all that are good, and do good. When Å¿pirits are overcome upon theÅ¿e terms, I know not who Å¿hall have greater cauÅ¿e to rejoyce, they who are Å¿ubject, or they who have made them Å¿o.</p>
            <p>But though this would be matter of great joy, yet this muÅ¿t not be either the totall or the chief matter of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing. The next words of the Text lead us to this modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>NotwithÅ¿tanding in this rejoyce not, but rather rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The connexion tells us, <hi>we are very apt to overact out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, and overjoy our worldly joy.</hi> The whole world is too narrow for the heart of man; Our joys may quickly exceed it, and we be more taken with it, then it is worth. ChriÅ¿t Å¿aw his DiÅ¿ciples in danger of taking in too much of the world. The creature gets quickly into our hearts, and our hearts may quickly get beyond the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Onely God is an object which we cannot overjoy, or Å¿tretch our affections too far towards. It is Å¿eldom that we can rejoyce at all (we can never rejoyce enough while we are in the fleÅ¿h) in Å¿pirituall mercies, and it is Å¿eldom but we rejoyce too much in temporall. The world is Å¿o much of kin to us, and is Å¿o like us: worldly comforts Å¿uit us Å¿o well, and are Å¿o neer us that while we deal about them, we need a bridle, not a Å¿purre.</p>
            <p>It is one of the greateÅ¿t priviledges which we wait for in Heaven, that our affections may bee ever kept in a due temper. There we Å¿hall love and rejoyce in nothing but God, or for God. And as we cannot love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113435:11"/> in God too much, Å¿o there we Å¿hall not love or rejoice in him too little. But while we converÅ¿e with creatures, we are apt to feed too heartily upon them, and to drink larger draughts of the wine of their conÅ¿olation then becomes us. The way to leÅ¿Å¿en earthly joy, is to Å¿tirre up heavenly. As when love is divided upon many objects of the Å¿ame worth, it cannot run Å¿o Å¿trongly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one: Å¿o much more, when it is carryed to a more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy object, will it abate towards thoÅ¿e which are leÅ¿Å¿e worthy. The Text is clear for it, teaching us;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That our receits of temporall and outward mercies, Å¿hould be but as an occaÅ¿ion to raiÅ¿e our hearts higher in rejoycing for Å¿pirituall and eternall mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>NotwithÅ¿tanding rejoyce not in this, that Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject to you, but rather rejoyce, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All creatures and comforts on earth, Å¿hould be but as foils to Å¿et off the glory of Heaven. How good is grace and glory, if there be Å¿o much good in nature? It was ChriÅ¿ts art to do thus, when he came to the well, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. and was thirÅ¿ty, he riÅ¿eth from that water and the thirÅ¿t he had to it, to tell the woman of another water, which if Å¿he could once drink, Å¿he Å¿hould never thirÅ¿t. And <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 27. when he Å¿aw his followers Å¿o hungry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loaves of bread, which is periÅ¿hing meat, He took an occaÅ¿ion to exhort them <hi>to labour for the meat that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿heth not, but endures to everlaÅ¿ting life.</hi> It is Å¿afeÅ¿t for us (as well as our duty) to beÅ¿tow the Å¿trength of our Å¿or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes upon our Å¿innes, and the Å¿trength of our joyes upon ChriÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>There is a double ground or reaÅ¿on, why we Å¿hould thus in our receits of temporall mercies, get our hearts off, or get our hearts above them.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, Å¿pirituall mercies are the beÅ¿t mercies. They
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:113435:12"/> are beÅ¿t in their nature, and they are beÅ¿t in their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they are laÅ¿ting mercies. The joy of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, all his joy is but for a moment: and the worldly joy of the Å¿incere is but for a moment. That cannot laÅ¿t long whoÅ¿e bottom and foundation cannot laÅ¿t long; <hi>the world paÅ¿Å¿eth away, and the faÅ¿hion of it;</hi> therefore the joy that ariÅ¿eth out of the world and the goodly faÅ¿hions of it, muÅ¿t needs paÅ¿Å¿e away too. When one of the Ancients Å¿tood by <hi>CaeÅ¿ars tomb,</hi> who had the honour (while he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) of Å¿o many victories and triumphs; he cries out, <hi>O CaeÅ¿ar, where is now thy magnificence? where are thy Armies? where are thy Trophies? where are the Towns and Cities which thou haÅ¿t overcome?</hi> They are all paÅ¿t away. We may Å¿ay as much of all our victories and deliverances, of beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the enemy in the field, of beating him out of Å¿trong holds; in a few yeers what will become of all theÅ¿e things, and of the worldly iÅ¿Å¿ues of them? Time will eat ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap> the remembrance of this glory. <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not Å¿o much queÅ¿tion, as chide, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 5.) <hi>wilt thou Å¿et thine heart upon that which is not?</hi> Can a man be in danger of Å¿etting his heart upon that, which hath not a being? <hi>Creatures have Å¿o little being, that they are Å¿aid to have no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Å¿o have all creature-comforts: wilt thou Å¿et thine heart upon that which is not?</hi> How long will the comfort of conqueÅ¿ts and victories laÅ¿t, that we Å¿hould rejoyce onely, or much in them?</p>
            <p>Secondly, if we confine our joyes to theÅ¿e, we are in a double danger. In a danger, FirÅ¿t of growing proud of, and confident upon our victories; nothing keeps the heart low but joy in the higheÅ¿t things. Ioy in low things makes the heart Å¿infully) high, and joy in high things makes the heart (graciouÅ¿ly low. That's the reaÅ¿o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> why the men of the world boaÅ¿t themÅ¿elves in their riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:113435:12"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the reaÅ¿on I Å¿ay, why they grow proud of theÅ¿e things, is becauÅ¿e they have nothing elÅ¿e to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in.</p>
            <p>Secondly by joying much in the creature, we are in danger to Å¿urfeit upon the creature, or to grow wanton with it. When the minde is Å¿teeped in our Å¿enÅ¿es, we can hardly get the taÅ¿te off again. We follow the world Å¿o much, becauÅ¿e it gives us Å¿o little: we are unceÅ¿Å¿ant in purÅ¿uing earthly contents, becauÅ¿e we Å¿till hope for more, and are unÅ¿atisfied with what we have. But when the heart once taÅ¿tes of Å¿pirituall dainties, it findes Å¿atisfaction; and being Å¿atisfied, deÅ¿ires to taÅ¿te them Å¿till: fulnes and hunger, Å¿atisfaction and appetite being perpetually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable. The taÅ¿te of heavenly things is Å¿o high and quick, that all beÅ¿ides taÅ¿tes flat and dreggiÅ¿h. No man (Å¿aith ChriÅ¿t) <hi>deÅ¿ireth new wine, having drunk the old, for he Å¿aith the old is better.</hi> Earthly comforts will not hold Å¿o fair a proportion to heavenly, as new wine doth to old. They differ not in degree onely, but in kinde. The creature hath alwaies an unÅ¿atisfyingneÅ¿Å¿e in it, and at the laÅ¿t it will have a bitternes. <hi>Prov. 25. 27. To eat much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is not good,</hi> (if a man eat honey long or often, it will not be honey to him) <hi>Å¿o for men to Å¿earch their own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is not glory,</hi> thus we tranÅ¿late it; but the text is well rendred, and cloÅ¿er to the Originall thus, <hi>To multiply to eat honey, or to eat much honey is not good, but the laÅ¿t of glory is glory.</hi> The Saints Å¿hall feed to eternity upon glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that will be alwaies glory: but honey, the beÅ¿t of worldly comforts will be gall, if you feed much upon them. Therefore correct your appetites after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; make your joy in worldly things an occaÅ¿ion and a Å¿tep to Å¿pirituall; doing Å¿o, three effects will flow from Å¿uch joy.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:113435:13"/>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, Å¿uch joys will make us very holy. Joy in worldly things alone, leaves us as worldly as it findes us: but if we mix it with Å¿pirituall, holines will mingle with our Å¿pirits. <hi>The Lord promiÅ¿es to give his people beauty for aÅ¿hes, the oyl of joy for mourning, the garment of praiÅ¿e for the Å¿pirit of heavineÅ¿se,</hi> (IÅ¿a. 61. 3.) here is the Lords joy: we have the effect of this in the next words: <hi>That they may be called, trees of righteouÅ¿nes, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified.</hi> If we rejoyce in the Lord, we Å¿hall rejoyce to the glory of the Lord; <hi>Trees of righteouÅ¿nes have their fruit in holines.</hi> It is a Å¿ad thing to Å¿ee what fruit the joy of moÅ¿t brings forth, intemperance, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneÅ¿Å¿e, Å¿enÅ¿uality, Å¿ecurity, injuÅ¿tice, fruits of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouÅ¿nes all.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Ioy thus temper'd makes us Å¿trong to Å¿erve the Lord; joy in the Lord carryes us to the Lord, <hi>Neh. 8. 10.) The joy of the Lord is our Å¿trength.</hi> Joy in the world weakens and flats our Å¿pirits: joy in the Lord, Å¿trength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens as well as purifies, and makes us at once holy and active.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Such joy makes us more then Å¿trong, exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing zealous for the Lord. After the people in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> time had feaÅ¿ted Å¿even dayes, the Å¿tory Å¿aith (2 <hi>Chron. 30. 23.) The whole aÅ¿sembly took counÅ¿el to keep other Å¿even days, and they kept other Å¿even days with gladneÅ¿Å¿e.</hi> Here were Å¿even and Å¿even days of feaÅ¿ting: it Å¿eems they loved feaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well; but the effect aÅ¿Å¿ures us, they did more then eat, drink and make merry at their feaÅ¿t. Their joy and gladnes, was not in corne, and wine and good chear: No, it was joy in the Lord, and in his goodnes; for they preÅ¿ently act like thoÅ¿e that had rejoyced in the Lord. Many in one dayes feaÅ¿t loÅ¿e the memory of the Lord, and of their own duty: but theÅ¿e in fourteendayes feaÅ¿ting
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113435:13"/> forgot neither. The firÅ¿t verÅ¿e of the next chapt. is clear for it; <hi>Now when all this was finiÅ¿hed,</hi> (a feaÅ¿t of fourteen dayes continuance) what did they then? Å¿ome might think them furniÅ¿ht for any kinde of wickednes: That they had eat and drunk out, not only their graces, but their wits, that now they were fit only to <hi>throw the houÅ¿e out at the windowes</hi> (as we Å¿ay) no, <hi>they threw Å¿in out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,</hi> Å¿o Å¿aith the Å¿tory, <hi>for when all this was finiÅ¿hed, all IÅ¿rael that were preÅ¿ent, went out to the Cities of</hi> Judah, <hi>and brake the images in pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars out of all</hi> Judah <hi>and</hi> Benjamin, <hi>in</hi> Ephraim <hi>alÅ¿o and</hi> ManaÅ¿Å¿eh, <hi>untill they had utterly destroyed them all,</hi> &amp;c. They made a perfect work of caÅ¿ting out whatÅ¿oever was diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ing unto God. Had they only taken pleaÅ¿ure in creatures, they had never done what was Å¿o pleaÅ¿ing unto God. Every thing we rejoyce moÅ¿t in, we are moÅ¿t zealous for. We Å¿hould rejoyce more in the God of our mercies, then in the mercies of God; and while we do Å¿o, we Å¿hall alÅ¿o rejoyce more in our duties, then in our mercies.</p>
            <p>We are this day called to rejoyce in an outward mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the reducing of a Å¿trong City. In this victory <hi>Å¿pirits are made Å¿ubject:</hi> in overco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ming evil men, we overcome evil Å¿pirits. I delight not to be a cenÅ¿urer at any time, leaÅ¿t of all at this; yet we know what a Å¿train, what a generation of men theÅ¿e were. If evil Å¿pirits have been made Å¿ubject in any part of the Kingdom, Å¿ome were in this. That place is diÅ¿poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed of many untoward Å¿pirits who poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed it long, and caÅ¿t much of it into the fire: TheÅ¿e are now caÅ¿t out by Å¿word and fire; But chiefly by thoÅ¿e better weapons of prayer and faÅ¿ting. ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ees, <hi>You are of your father the Devil,</hi> (Joh. 8. 44.) And <hi>Polycarp</hi> in the Church Å¿tory, called <hi>Marcion,</hi> the <hi>firÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113435:14"/> of the Devil.</hi> All ungodly men are of the Å¿ame line and race. There is very little difference between the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and a wicked man, but fleÅ¿h and bones; Hence in common Å¿peech we call very wicked men <hi>Devils incarnate;</hi> I may Å¿ay (without breach of charity) <hi>Devils incarnate</hi> are made Å¿ubject at this day, and their Å¿ubjection is the Å¿ubject of this days rejoycing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Notwithstanding in this rejoyce not, that theÅ¿e Å¿pirits are Å¿ubject to you;</hi> rejoyce not much in this. ChriÅ¿t (<hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 23.) Å¿peaks of Å¿ome who had the power and priviledge, to make Devils in kinde Å¿ubject to them, many (Å¿aith he) <hi>Å¿hall come to me in that day, and Å¿ay, Lord, Lord, we have prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ied in thy name, and in thy name we have caÅ¿t out Devils, and we have done many wonderfull works;</hi> yet theÅ¿e wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workers had little cauÅ¿e to rejoyce. It is poÅ¿Å¿ible for a man not only to Å¿ubdue the evil Å¿pirits of men, but to Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due evil Å¿pirits themÅ¿elves, (take them in their naturall notion) and yet to have no cauÅ¿e of rejoycing; I am Å¿ure they had not; becauÅ¿e while they had power over De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, themÅ¿elves were under the power of the Devil. The Devils were Å¿ubject to them, yet they were the Devils Å¿ervants. ChriÅ¿t diÅ¿cards them under that relation, <hi>ver. 24. Depart from me, ye that work iniquity;</hi> and whoÅ¿e work is that? I know none who put men to that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or drudgery rather, but only Satan, <hi>his Å¿ervice is the work of iniquity;</hi> Å¿ome may caÅ¿t out Devils who take in the work of the Devil. Hence, they who have caÅ¿t out Devils, may be caÅ¿t to the Devil. Had we this power to caÅ¿t out Devils in kinde, our joy would quickly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, unleÅ¿Å¿e we have learned to out-joy it. To further which deÅ¿igne upon theÅ¿e worldly joyes, I would Å¿peak a few words.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, to thoÅ¿e who have more to rejoyce in then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113435:14"/> over men and cities. Secondly, to thoÅ¿e who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a true account, have no more to rejoyce in.</p>
            <p>To the former my motion is. Make the mercies of this day an occaÅ¿ion to act your joy upon eternall mercies. It is poÅ¿Å¿ible for a godly man to Å¿uffer the Å¿tream of his joy to run more then is meet in a worldly chanell. The beÅ¿t have reaÅ¿on enough to be jealous over their own hearts.</p>
            <p>You are called to rejoyce, and I am not a forbidder, I would be a helper of your joy. Joy is comely, and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of praiÅ¿e in faÅ¿hion this day. Therefore Å¿ay to your Å¿ouls, Let us rejoyce, and let all that is within us bleÅ¿Å¿e the holy name of God for the great things he hath done for us; when you have done this, Å¿peak again to your Å¿ouls in the language of the text; O our Å¿ouls, rejoyce in better things then theÅ¿e, Let us rejoyce that our names are written in Heaven. Drink not too large draughts of thoÅ¿e worldly comforts, go to that which is better and richer wine, take your fill in the conÅ¿olations of God.</p>
            <p>To quicken this, I might Å¿hew you many moÅ¿t deÅ¿irable objects. I will only hint a few: rejoyce that <hi>JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t</hi> hath made a perfect conqueÅ¿t for you over Å¿pirituall enemies, rejoyce that ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿poiled principalities and powers, and dragged the Devil at his chariot of triumph, when he aÅ¿cended up to heaven: rejoyce that ChriÅ¿t hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come death and Å¿ubdued the grave: rejoyce that ChriÅ¿t died to free you from death, and hath brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light through the GoÅ¿pel: rejoyce that ChriÅ¿t hath Å¿trengthned you to withÅ¿tand temptations, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you power to conquer paÅ¿Å¿ion: rejoyce that ChriÅ¿t by accompliÅ¿hing the work of redemption, hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaÅ¿ed the pardon of Å¿in, peace with God, and an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which Å¿adeth not away; rejoyce that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113435:15"/> a City for you, which no Armies Å¿hall lay Å¿iege un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, or Å¿hoot an arrow againÅ¿t: rejoyce that he hath provided an eÅ¿tate for you that Å¿hall never be Å¿pent, and a Kingdom which Å¿hall never be Å¿haken. When you hear men are made Å¿ubject to men, rejoyce that ChriÅ¿t hath made you Å¿ubject to himÅ¿elf: when you hear Å¿trong holds are taken, rejoyce that the Å¿trong holds of Å¿in are bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered down and taken: that there is not an evil imagination in you, but if it Å¿tir, you have a weapon in readines, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge that diÅ¿obedience. When you heare how they who have fought againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t are brought low, rejoyce that you are not fighting againÅ¿t ChriÅ¿t, that you are not trampling his precious blood under your feet, that you delight not in that, by which the holy Å¿pirit is grieved. Let looÅ¿e your affections upon theÅ¿e better, higher and more noble objects: rejoyce here as much as you can. <hi>It is altogether below the state of a Saint to rejoyce only in things that are below.</hi>

            <p>Secondly, I would offer a word to thoÅ¿e who have none of theÅ¿e mercies to rejoyce in, who have nothing but a world to rejoyce in. Poor Å¿ouls! what do you rejoycing? what do you keeping dayes of thankÅ¿gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving for victories obtained againÅ¿t men and Cities? can you rejoyce on theÅ¿e terms? can you rejoyce in hopes of peace upon earth, when war is proclaimed againÅ¿t you in Heaven? Can you rejoyce that Cities are Å¿ubdued, when your hearts are unÅ¿ubdued? Can you give thanks this day that the City of <hi>CheÅ¿ter</hi> is taken in, after five or Å¿ix Moneths Å¿iege, when as your own hearts have Å¿tood out Å¿even and Å¿even yeers Å¿iege againÅ¿t the continuall batteries of the Word? Can you rejoyce that Å¿trong holds are demoliÅ¿hed, when you fortify and gariÅ¿on Å¿trong holds with legions of luÅ¿ts, with covetouÅ¿nes, pride, Å¿elf-love,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113435:15"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When you victuall them, and lay in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, to make them hold out as long as you live againÅ¿t JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, Can you rejoyce? Rather go home and weep over theÅ¿e mercies; weep over victories and Å¿uc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿es. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your Å¿ong of joy into a lamentation. Leave joy to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Will you keep a day of rejoycing, who are likely to mourn and weep for ever? reÅ¿t not in reÅ¿tleÅ¿Å¿e things, live not in an eÅ¿tate wherein you are unfit to dy. All the world is not worth the rejoycing in, unleÅ¿Å¿e ye have Å¿ome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elÅ¿e to rejoyce in. God forbid (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle, <hi>Gal 6. 14.) That I Å¿hould rejoyce in any thing, Å¿ave in the croÅ¿se of our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t.</hi> If you have not ChriÅ¿t to rejoyce in, God forbids all your other joyes: and your Å¿orrowes will be the more bitter to you hereafter, by how much your joyes have been now more Å¿weet. Weep, (if any Å¿uch now offer at this duty) weep proud hearts, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous hearts, envious Å¿pirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> weep till you bring ChriÅ¿t the Å¿poyl of your luÅ¿ts, till you Å¿hew him the ruines of your corruptions: weep till you bring him broken hearts, till you bring him wills Å¿tooping to his word, and Å¿pirits made Å¿ubject to his Å¿pirit: weep till you finde Å¿uch matter of joy as the text Å¿peaks of, an evidence that your names are written in heaven.</p>
            <q>
               <l>But rather rejoyce that your names are written in Heaven.</l>
               <l>The names of the Saints are written in Heaven.</l>
            </q>
            <p>If Å¿o, Then, firÅ¿t they are Å¿afe, their eÅ¿tate is Å¿etled, their names are taken into the liÅ¿t of bleÅ¿Å¿ednes.</p>
            <p>2. They are honourable. A man under diÅ¿grace hath his name written in the duÅ¿t: but to have a name enrolled in Heaven, is an expreÅ¿Å¿ion of the higheÅ¿t honour.</p>
            <p>3. They Å¿hall be had in everlaÅ¿ting remembrance, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:113435:16"/> Å¿hall be able to obliterate or raÅ¿e out a name that is written in Heaven. <hi>EuÅ¿ebius</hi> reports of <hi>Herod,</hi> that he burnt all the genealogies of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that himÅ¿elf might be miÅ¿taken for a <hi>Jew.</hi> But no <hi>Herod,</hi> with his power and pride, Å¿hall ever burn or deface the roll of election: Names written in that Å¿hall not be blotted out: The land of forgetfullnes lyes all on this Å¿ide heaven.</p>
            <p>Is not this a ground of great joy, and Å¿trong conÅ¿olati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Saints? PoÅ¿Å¿ibly their names are blotted here upon the earth, but there is no blot upon them in heaven. God doth not delight to take notice of the failings and miÅ¿carriages of his Å¿ervants, much leÅ¿Å¿e will he deface their names, when they miÅ¿carry. In Scripture, Å¿ome miÅ¿carriages of the Saints are recorded (which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves are blots) but the end why they are recorded is for our warning, not for their Å¿hame: which yet is the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of moÅ¿t on earth, who induÅ¿triouÅ¿ly write books of the <hi>Saints <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> rata's,</hi> whether in opinion or in practice. It it very dangerous to blot names which are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. ChriÅ¿t would not have any Å¿in flattered in any man, but, ChriÅ¿t would not have all Å¿ins diÅ¿covered in all men; therefore he hath provided a covering, not that which is the ordinary covering, Å¿elf-flattery, or the flattery of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The covering he hath provided is, <hi>charity, charity covereth a multitude of Å¿ins,</hi> (1 Pet. 4. 8.) Surely their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is very narrow, or if it be not narrow, I wonder what uÅ¿e they put it to, who will hardly cover one infirmity of an offending brother. Yea, Å¿ome are Å¿o greedy after of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, that though they are covered, yet they uncover them, and are Å¿o far from caÅ¿ting a garment over what appears, that they pull off the very Å¿eals of Å¿ecrecy to make all appear.</p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:113435:16"/>
            <p>It doth not become <hi>men</hi> to do Å¿o, much leÅ¿Å¿e <hi>Saints.</hi> But as to Å¿uffer theÅ¿e blots is the patience of the Saints on earth, Å¿o it is their joy to hear that there are no blots upon their names in heaven. Be of good comfortt, though men blot, God will not. For as he Å¿peaks to <hi>MoÅ¿es;</hi> deÅ¿iring not a blot upon his name, but the blotting out of his name, <hi>Exod. 32. 32. Blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou haÅ¿t written.</hi> Blot thee, <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> Å¿aith God? No, I will never blot thee, I will put no blots upon Å¿uch names as thine; much leÅ¿Å¿e blot Å¿uch names out. There was a failing in that Å¿peech of <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> and Å¿ome interpret that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ire of his to be his blot: yet God doth not put it as a blot upon <hi>MoÅ¿es,</hi> but Å¿aith, <hi>WhoÅ¿oever hath Å¿inned againÅ¿t me, him will I blot out of my book.</hi> God is Å¿o far from deÅ¿iring to blot the names of his people, that he will not blot them, though they themÅ¿elves Å¿hould deÅ¿ire it. He will neither blot them out of his book; nor blot them in his book; He will do neither, he keeps the names of his Saints fair written for ever.</p>
            <p>Then (which is the laÅ¿t point) <hi>It is matter of great joy to have our names written in Heaven. This is a priviledge worth the having, To be in Gods books.</hi> Heer's honour indeed, <hi>To be of the Church of the firÅ¿t-borne, whoÅ¿e names are written in Heaven,</hi> Heb. 12. 23. They who have their names written higheÅ¿t in the earth, Å¿hould be moÅ¿t deÅ¿irous to have their names written thus high. They that are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and great, they that are men <hi>of name in the world,</hi> as the giants are intitled, (<hi>Gen. 6. 4. at that time there were men of name, men of renown</hi>) Å¿uch Å¿hould be moÅ¿t ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of being men of name above.</p>
            <p>My Lords, your names are written very high here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And it is my prayer that your names may be written
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:113435:17"/> higher, that even your earthly honours and dignities may encreaÅ¿e, and that your <hi>Fame</hi> may be as an ointment poured out, perfuming not only this Kingdom, but the world, with your juÅ¿t and heroicall actions. Yet let it not Å¿uffice <hi>You</hi> (Å¿uch ambition is a vertue) I Å¿ay let it not Å¿atisfie <hi>You,</hi> who have Å¿o great a name upon the earth, to have a name upon the earth; I would not have it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the meaneÅ¿t man upon earth, much leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿hould it content <hi>your LordÅ¿hips</hi> who have <hi>Great eÅ¿tates, Great digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Great titles, Great families, Great AnceÅ¿tors, Great Å¿pirits,</hi> to have names narrowed up to this earth, this little molehill of earth. It is a duty for the greateÅ¿t perÅ¿ons, (if God call them to it) to be contented with a little of the earth: but it is a Å¿inne for the meaneÅ¿t perÅ¿on to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with all the earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luther</hi> Å¿poke himÅ¿elf <hi>a Protestant indeed,</hi> while he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿ted, <hi>I will never be Å¿atisfied with the creature. The great world</hi> is not big enough for the epitome of it, <hi>The little world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Lords, there are not very many names (if we Å¿peak comparatively) written in heaven at all; the roll is not large which contains thoÅ¿e inÅ¿criptions. And the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Å¿peaks of the <hi>Noble and Honourable</hi> (which it doth but of one Å¿ort of men more) with a diminution, (1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26.) Not many wiÅ¿e men after the fleÅ¿h, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> There are not very many in all called, and of thoÅ¿e there are not <hi>many mighty, nor many noble;</hi> This Å¿hould not be a diÅ¿couragement, but a Å¿purre to your Honours. Do not think that this Scripture ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿itates any of <hi>You</hi> to be left out: many will not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, though all your <hi>LordÅ¿hips</hi> be. There are <hi>Nobles</hi> enow in the world, in whom this text will be verified
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113435:17"/> and made good, though it be not in any of your <hi>Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number.</hi> Let it fill all your hearts with holy jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louÅ¿ies concerning your Å¿elves, not with deÅ¿pondencies, much leÅ¿Å¿e deÅ¿pairs concerning any of your Å¿elves.</p>
            <p>When ChriÅ¿t Å¿aid to his <hi>twelve DiÅ¿ciples, One of you Å¿hall betray me,</hi> it put them all upon this Å¿uÅ¿picion, who it Å¿hould be, and one Å¿aid, <hi>Master, is it I? another, Master, is it I?</hi> When the Holy GhoÅ¿t in this Scripture Å¿aith, <hi>Not many noble are called,</hi> it Å¿hould put all that are Noble upon this InquiÅ¿ition, <hi>Lord, am I called? Lord, am I? Is my name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Heaven? is mine?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be asked: but with what Å¿pectacles Å¿hall we reade at Å¿uch a diÅ¿tance? How Å¿hall we diÅ¿cern whether our names are written in heaven or no?</p>
            <p>I intend not to enter upon a diÅ¿courÅ¿e of Å¿ignes and tokens; but as the ApoÅ¿tle anÅ¿wers them, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 6.) who were making Quaeries about ChriÅ¿t, <hi>Say not in thine heart, Who Å¿hall aÅ¿cend up to heaven?</hi> they made great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, how to get neer ChriÅ¿t, how to know him: <hi>Å¿ay not in thine heart</hi> (Å¿aith he) have not theÅ¿e reaÅ¿onings, <hi>Who Å¿hall aÅ¿cend up to heaven?</hi> With what ladders Å¿hall we Å¿cale the clouds? or with what wings Å¿hall we Å¿oar up thither? Trouble not thy Å¿elf (Å¿aith the ApoÅ¿tle) with theÅ¿e thoughts, thou Å¿halt not be put to Å¿o long a journey, <hi>for the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart the word of faith which we preach.</hi> I Å¿ay likewiÅ¿e to theÅ¿e <hi>QuaeriÅ¿ts,</hi> Say not in your hearts, who Å¿hall aÅ¿cend up to heaven to Å¿ee, whether his name be written there, or how Å¿hall we Å¿end a meÅ¿Å¿enger thither to Å¿earch the records? You may Å¿ave that journey, the word is neer you, the word is before you, even the word of faith and of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which we preach.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:113435:18"/>
            <p>If the name of God be written in your hearts, your names are written in Heaven.</p>
            <p>If you in your actions daily write out a copy of this book, aÅ¿Å¿ure your Å¿elves the hand of God hath written you in his book. The lives of the Saints Å¿hould be a continued copying out of the book of God. He that writes out the book of God in his life, may reÅ¿t aÅ¿Å¿ured his name is written in the book of life.</p>
